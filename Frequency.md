## Channel raster
### ARFCN
The fundimental of frequency is kHZ. The different of ARFCN and GSCN lies in the different _presentation_ of frequency(in kHZ).\
The mapping of frequency(F<sub>REF</sub>) and ARFCN number(N<sub>REF</sub>) is F<sub>REF</sub> = F<sub>REF-Offs</sub> + Î”F<sub>Global</sub>(N<sub>REF</sub>-N<sub>REF-Offs</sub>).with the ARFCN number(N<sub>REF</sub>), the channel raster is deifned by

### GSCN
The mapping of frequency and GSCN is in a different way(just in different mapping way).\

By the selection of N and M, we will get different GSCN. with the GSCN, we can find out the operating band.\
(_note: if the operating band is fixed(in other words, ARFCN fall in the range of **THE** operating band, GSCN must selected from corresponding range value_)

### Why GSCN and ARFCN
The main idea is to faster cell search. Cause the granuity of GSCN is bigger(rougher) than ARFCN.

## Frequency domain location
### Reference subcarrier spacing(sub 6g and mmWave)

The difference lies in the subcarrier spacing(SCS). In sub6G, the SCS is 15kHZ while mmWave is 60kHZ(Just the granuity of band).PRB0 presents the reference point (**PointA** if I make no mistakes)\
#### Why we need point A?
In 5G, there is a new concept, **Bandwidth part(BWP)**, which means there are many BWP in one band, for different purposes. In order to seperate and flexible arrange these BWPs, there are 2 ways: \
1. the parameter _offsetToPointA_ defines the the lowest subcarrier spacing resource block(RB) offsets to the Point A. This RB is used for UE to cell search.
2. Parameter _absoluteFrequencyPointA_ for all other cases where _absoluteFrequencyPointA_ represents the frequency-location of point A expressed as in ARFCN.\
In SSB, the following pic shows the two parameters: K_ssb and $N_{CRB}^{SSB}$, to decide the position of SSB in band.
